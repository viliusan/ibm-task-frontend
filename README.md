# GNews Articles App

The front-end side of the application for the IBM Task

# Description

This is a newspaper website application that lets the user search for news articles using a search bar, or filter shown articles by a topic category. It also logs user actions in the back-end and saves them in a Mongo DB. The front-end side is written with React.js, while the back-end is built on Node.js.

# Installation

To install and run the project locally, first you must clone both 'ibm-task-frontend' and 'ibm-task' repositories into your machine, and then run `npm install` for both folders to install the required dependencies.

Next, start both projects with `npm start` and you are good to go! Front-end will be running on port 3000, back-end runs on port 9999

User action history, such as search queries and details about clicked articles will also be stored in MongoDB. Look for `userActions` database after navigating through the application.

# Usage

To use the application, simply use the search input to find articles about anything you like. Keep in mind, that the search input only allows alphanumeric characters and spaces. Clicking on an article will open it on a new tab. You can also select a topic from a drop-down menu and articles of that topic will be displayed.

Another thing worth mentioning is that the API gives you 100 calls every day. So spamming the application for API calls is not recommended as it will stop functioning.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
